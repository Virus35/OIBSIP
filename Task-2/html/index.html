            <h3>HTML 5</h3>
          </div>
          <p>
            HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting
            content on the World Wide Web. It is the fifth and last[3] major
            HTML version that is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)
            recommendation. The current specification is known as the HTML
            Living Standard. It is maintained by the Web Hypertext Application
            Technology Working Group (WHATWG), a consortium of the major browser
            vendors (Apple, Google, Mozilla, and Microsoft).

          </div>
          <p>
            Generally, the term css5 stands for cascading style sheet version 5.
            Although there are many types of versions are available for CSS, but
            people often confuse with which version of CSS is running at the
            current time. There are mainly two types of CSS one is css2 and
            another is css3, and the term css3 is actually using for CSS 3.2
            version. This is actually the upgraded and the updated version of
            css3. We can say that CSS 3.2 version is often known as css5
            version.

          <p>
            JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to
            implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does
            more than just sit there and display static information for you to
            look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps,
            animated 2D/3D graphics, etc. — you can
            bet that JavaScript is probably involved.JavaScript is a scripting
            or programming language that allows you to implement complex
            features on web pages.

            modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features
            in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation.
            C++ can be found in today's operating systems and embedded systems.
